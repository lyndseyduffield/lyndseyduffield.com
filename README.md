# My Site

This is my personal website, hand-written in HTML and CSS with a light sprinkling of JavaScript. It's available on [lyndseyduffield.com](https://lyndseyduffield.com).

### Development

Development happens in the `index.html` and `main.scss` files. To generate the CSS from the SCSS file, run:

```sh
npm run scss
```
